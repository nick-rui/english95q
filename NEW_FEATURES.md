## üí° Implementation Notes

### Why This Approach?

1. **User Agency**: Readers can explore non-linearly
2. **Visual Metaphor**: The road itself becomes the navigation
3. **Engagement**: Interactive elements increase engagement
4. **Accessibility**: Multiple ways to navigate
5. **Mobile First**: Works great on phones

### Design Philosophy

The yellow brick road is not just decoration‚Äîit's Dorothy's path. By making it interactive, users literally follow in her footsteps, choosing their own journey through Oz while the Road watches and remembers.

This aligns perfectly with the narrative themes:
- **Agency**: Users, like Dorothy, can choose their path
- **Memory**: The Road remembers where you've been (visited bricks)
- **Journey**: The visual progress shows the journey unfolding

---

## üéâ Impact

This enhancement transforms the slideshow from a **linear presentation** into an **interactive experience**. Users can:
- Explore at their own pace
- Jump to favorite sections
- Compare different parts
- Navigate naturally and intuitively

The visual metaphor of Dorothy traveling the road makes the abstract concept of "navigation" concrete and story-driven.

**The Road is not just a path‚Äîit's your guide through the story. üü°‚Üíüü°‚Üíüü°**

*Click any brick and let Dorothy lead the way.*
