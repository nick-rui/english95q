    narration: `I am a brick. One of millions. I am part of the Road. The Yellow Brick Road.

You know the story. Or you think you do.

I am 1,847,293 bricks long. I stretch from Munchkin Country to the Emerald City. Nine hundred and seventeen miles. Three hundred and seven years old. And I remember everything.

The humans who walk upon me think I am merely a path—something to be used, worn down, forgotten. They do not know that I am sentient. That every footstep leaves an impression deeper than weight. That I carry not just bodies but histories, dreams, desperation, hope.

For over three hundred years, I have been the spine of Oz. The connection between worlds. The promise of something better at the end of a long walk.

But I have also been complicit. In exploitation. In surveillance. In the machinery of power that grinds people into dust while calling it opportunity.

You know Dorothy's story—the girl, the tornado, the silver shoes, the Wizard behind the curtain.

But what about the path beneath her feet? What about the workers who built me? The children who ran across me barefoot? The surveillance apparatus that uses me to track every traveler?

I am infrastructure. I am invisible until I break. Ignored until needed. Taken for granted until gone.

Let me tell you what I saw. Let me tell you what they don't say about Oz.

Shall we begin?`,

    subtitle: "How Infrastructure Is Born",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide2-construction.png",
    narration: `There's a woman buried beneath me. Not literally—though there might be, I was never told—but her life is here. Her blood in the mortar. Her breath in the brick.

Her name was Kella. She was Munchkin, forty-two years old when the Wizard's decree went out: Build a road. Unite Oz. Make it yellow, make it grand, make it impossible to look away from.

She laid 10,000 of my bricks. I know because I counted with her. She sang while she worked—old Munchkin harvest songs, songs about grain and rain and coming home. By the second month, she stopped singing. By the sixth month, her hands bled through the cloth wrappings. By the tenth month, the songs had been replaced by silence and the wet, rattling cough that comes before the end.

The overseers—always from the Emerald City, always well-fed—stood in the shade and shouted commands. "Faster! Straighter! The Wizard demands perfection!"

Perfection is expensive when measured in human years.

Kella died the winter the Road was completed. Pneumonia. There was a grand ceremony for the Road's opening—dignitaries, speeches, the Wizard himself in his great floating head illusion. Kella's family couldn't afford the three-day journey to attend. They walked me once, years later, looking for the section she built.

I wanted to tell them: here, this mile, these bricks, your mother's hands shaped this, your mother's breath gave this life.

But roads don't speak to the living. We only remember the dead.

This is my first memory: I was built by people whose names you'll never know. And I carry them still.`,

    subtitle: "The Economics of Movement",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide3-travelers.png",
    narration: `I can tell you the price of everything that passed over me in the year 1842.

Munchkin corn: 3 silver pieces per bushel. Winkie tin: 8 gold per ingot. Quadling dyed silk: 15 gold per bolt. The life of a traveling merchant who stopped to rest at mile marker 456 and never woke up: apparently worthless, because no one came looking.

His name was Geldin. He carried ledgers—careful, cramped handwriting documenting every transaction, every profit margin, every coin. He was walking me back to his family in the Emerald City, loaded with goods from a successful trading season in the south.

Bandits? Heart failure? Simple exhaustion? I'll never know. But I felt him collapse. Felt his cart overturn. Felt his goods scatter across my bricks—fine cloth and raw metal and those precious ledgers, pages fluttering open, all his careful accounting exposed to the wind and rain.

Other travelers passed. Most walked around him. One stopped long enough to steal a bolt of silk. Two days later, a official patrol came through, logged the body, confiscated the remaining goods "for the City treasury," and left Geldin in an unmarked grave by my side.

His ledgers survived. I watched the ink blur and fade over weeks, his life's work becoming illegible, meaningless, forgotten.

Here's what the ledgers never recorded: the weight of hope in a merchant's step at the start of a journey. The lightness of relief when home appears on the horizon. The exact measure of a life spent walking between markets, between family and profit, between surviving and living.

I am the infrastructure of commerce. I make trade efficient. And I am littered with the bones of those who couldn't keep pace.`,

    subtitle: "A Study in Routine",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide4-boots.png",
    narration: `For twenty-three years, Bolek's day began with me.

4:30 AM. Every morning. The same footsteps, the same rhythm, the same heavy boots that wore a groove into my surface between mile markers 312 and 329.

He was Winkie, a master craftsman once, renowned for intricate metalwork—clockwork birds that sang, mechanical flowers that bloomed on command. Then the Emerald City factories learned to mass-produce cheaper versions. His workshop closed. His apprentices scattered. His hands, trained for delicate work, became hands that pulled levers in a factory making parts for machines he would never see completed.

I learned his rhythm. Left foot slightly heavier—an old injury. A pause every morning at marker 318 to catch his breath. The drag of exhaustion more pronounced every year.

He never walked with anyone. No companions on the 4:30 AM march. Just thousands of workers moving like blood through veins, feeding the heart of the City with their labor.

Twenty-three years. Then one day, his footsteps stopped.

His daughter's footsteps began three weeks later. Lighter, but the same route. The same 4:30 AM start. Perhaps paying his debts. Perhaps the factory wouldn't release his final wages unless someone finished his contract. Perhaps she simply had no other choice.

Three years for her. Then her footsteps stopped too.

I have grooves like this all along my length. Patterns worn by daily routine, by economic necessity, by the simple fact that people have to eat and the City has all the food.

Infrastructure doesn't just carry people. It channels them. Directs them. Traps them in grooves they wear deeper with every passing year until the groove becomes a rut and the rut becomes a grave.

Bolek is gone. His daughter is gone. But their groove remains.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide5-soldiers.png",
    narration: `Checkpoint 7. Mile marker 687. The place where people stop existing in official records and start existing only in my memory.

The soldiers are meticulous. They log everything: names, origins, destinations, cargo, affiliations, "suspicious behavior"—which can mean anything from carrying too many pamphlets to making eye contact with the wrong person.

I've felt thousands of arrests. Most are quiet. A hand on the shoulder. A polite request to "step aside for additional questioning." The traveler's footsteps leaving my bricks, moving onto the dirt shoulder, then nothing. They don't scream. They don't run. They've learned.

But I remember them. Every single one.

Elara, the poet. She made it to checkpoint 7 with pamphlets of verse about freedom. The soldiers found them. "Sedition," they said. "Unauthorized hope," they meant.

Reynard, the Fox. Traveled from the Western forest to petition for Animal rights. Third time attempting the journey. The law said Animals needed travel permits. The permit office refused to issue him one. Circular logic is still a circle when you're walking it. He never made it to checkpoint 8.

Mira, the factory organizer. Wanted workers to have the right to rest. Revolutionary concept. The soldiers had informant reports before she even reached my start. They let her walk 683 miles before arresting her. Efficient. Cruel. Lets everyone else watch and learn: resistance is exhausting and ultimately futile.

The Wizard calls this "security." The soldiers call it "maintaining order." 

I call it what it is: terror made routine. Power made invisible. Control disguised as protection.

The soldiers' boots are polished, their rhythm measured and perfect. They march over the disappeared as if they were never there.

But I remember. I hold their names in my bricks. I am the unofficial ledger, the record the state won't keep.

Someone should remember. Something should bear witness.

Even if it's only the road.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide6-child-footprints.png",
    narration: `He was eight years old. Maybe nine. It's hard to tell age from footprints, and his feet were small, bare, and moving fast.

It was winter—the kind of cold that makes your breath visible, that turns tears to ice on your cheeks before they can fall. He wore thin clothes. He carried nothing. He ran.

His name? I don't know. Where he came from? Somewhere west. Where he was going? The City, always the City, the place where people believe problems can be solved if you just walk far enough.

He fell at my midpoint—mile marker 458—and lay there so long I thought he might never get up. He was crying, but quietly, the way children cry when they've learned that being loud makes things worse.

I wanted to warm him. Wanted to speak. Wanted to say: rest here, someone will come, you are not alone. But infrastructure is mute. We are present but powerless. We witness but cannot intervene.

He stood. Kept running. His footprints—small, barefoot, uneven—continued east for another 300 miles. Then they vanished into the traffic approaching the City gates, indistinguishable from the thousands of other footprints that converge at that point.

Did he make it? Did someone help him? Did he find what he was running toward or escape what he was running from?

307 years. I still don't know. I'll never know.

This is the cruelty of being infrastructure: I am present for the beginning of stories but almost never for their endings. I carry people toward their futures but never learn what those futures hold.

I have hundreds of thousands of stories like his. Fragments. Questions. Lives interrupted by my ending or beginning, never completed, never resolved.

I remember him because someone should. Even if it's only me. Even if it changes nothing.

He was real. He ran barefoot in winter. He deserves to be more than forgotten.`,

    subtitle: "How Change Arrives",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide7-cyclone.png",
    narration: `The cyclone came from nowhere—which is to say, it came from Kansas, which to Oz might as well be nowhere.

I felt it before it arrived. A pressure change. A vibration in the air. The way birds go silent before a storm. The Munchkins scattered, sought shelter, prayed to gods who rarely answered. And then the house fell.

It landed just beyond my first brick, at the very edge of Munchkin Country where I begin my long stretch toward the Emerald City. It fell on the Wicked Witch of the East—the Wizard's own appointed governor, his enforcer of taxes and tributes and order. Crushed her. Killed her instantly.

The Munchkins erupted in celebration. They'd been terrified of her for decades, bent under her rule, and now she was dead. Dead by accident. Dead by a house from another world. Dead by a girl who had no idea what she'd done or what it meant.

Dorothy Gale stepped out onto me, and I knew immediately she was different.

Her shoes were silver—not ruby as the stories later claimed. Silver. Powerful. Wrong. Magical in a way that felt foreign, dangerous, not bound by Oz's rules. They pressed into me with weight that wasn't physical, a presence that made my bricks hum with something I'd never felt before.

She looked down at me and said: "It's so yellow."

As if color were all I was. As if I didn't carry centuries of history in my length, stories in my grooves, blood in my mortar.

But there was something about her. Not innocence—innocence is a luxury—but a kind of... clarity. She saw what she saw. She asked what she wanted to know. She didn't bow to authority or power or fear the way everyone in Oz had learned to.

Glinda appeared, all political theater and strategic benevolence, and told Dorothy to walk me. "Follow the Yellow Brick Road," she said, pointing, as if I were merely directions.

Dorothy started walking. Her three companions would join her soon—the wise fool, the loving machine, the fearful brave. Together they would unmask the Wizard. Together they would break something that had needed breaking for a very long time.

But in that first moment, it was just her. Just Dorothy. Just a girl from Kansas stepping onto me with silver shoes and no idea she was about to change everything.

Change always arrives by accident. From nowhere. From Kansas. From the sky.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide8-fellowship.png",
    narration: `They came together like a story assembling itself. Each thought they were broken. Each was searching for the piece that would make them whole.

The Scarecrow first. I'd felt him hanging there for months—conscious, aware, trapped on a pole in a field, watching travelers pass and longing to join them. His mind was sharp, constantly thinking, but he'd convinced himself that thoughts without a brain didn't count as intelligence. When Dorothy took him down, his first steps were ecstatic. Clumsy, yes—he was learning to walk—but joyful. Free. He asked questions constantly. Wondered about everything. Proved his intelligence with every word while claiming he had none.

The Tin Man next. Rusted in the woods for over a year, frozen mid-swing, unable to move or speak but fully aware. I'd carried rain to him, puddle by puddle. My fault, perhaps, that he couldn't move. When Dorothy found oil and freed him, he wept—or tried to. "I have no heart," he said, while mourning the woodsman he used to be, while caring deeply for Dorothy's safety, while demonstrating more compassion than any of the City's well-fed bureaucrats. He proved his heart with every act of kindness while claiming he had none.

The Lion last. All roar and terror, attacking travelers, performing ferocity. But when Dorothy slapped him for threatening Toto, he crumbled. Admitted his fear. Confessed that he'd been faking courage for so long he'd forgotten what real bravery felt like. And then he joined them—walked toward the most dangerous place in Oz, toward the Wizard himself—while claiming he had no courage. He proved his bravery with every step while believing he had none.

And Dorothy, carrying them all forward. Looking for a way home, walking a path that kept teaching her she already had the power to leave. She just needed to believe in it. To recognize it. To click her heels three times and own the magic that was hers all along.

Four people. Four quests. Four discoveries that what they sought was already within them.

I carried them through danger and wonder. Felt their fellowship deepen. Felt them become family in the way people do when they share a journey, a purpose, a revelation that they're all more than they thought and that maybe being incomplete isn't a curse but just part of being alive.

They taught me something: brokenness is not the opposite of wholeness. Sometimes the cracks are where the light gets in. Sometimes the journey is the answer. Sometimes you find what you need by walking with people who need the same thing.

They were beautiful. Broken and whole. Lost and found. Incomplete and perfect.

I miss them still.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide9-emerald-city.png",
    narration: `They pave over me near the City. Cover my yellow bricks with emerald glass—or glass painted to look like emerald, or glass that catches light in green ways, or maybe it's real emerald. I've never been told. I'm infrastructure. I don't get explanations, only transformations.

It's beautiful, I'll admit. Glittering. Radiant. The kind of beauty that makes you forget to ask questions like "why" or "for whom" or "at what cost."

At the gates, the Guardian hands out green-tinted glasses. "To protect your eyes from the brilliance," he intones, solemn as a priest. "The Emerald City is so beautiful, so radiant, that without these glasses, you'd be blinded by its glory."

Lie. Beautiful lie. Necessary lie. Lie that everyone believes because they want to.

The glasses tint everything green—the buildings, the streets, the people's faces. Remove them, and you'd see grey stone. Chipped paint. Cracked plaster. Reality.

But no one removes them. Because the lie is so much prettier than the truth, and because everyone around you believes the lie, and because questioning it marks you as difficult, disloyal, dangerous.

I know because I'm underneath it all. Under the emerald glass, under the spectacle, under the lie. I'm still yellow. Still the same bricks laid by Kella's bleeding hands. But nobody sees me anymore. They see only what they're told to see.

Dorothy believed it at first. I felt her heartbeat quicken as the spires came into view. Felt her steps speed with excitement. She thought she'd finally reached the place where her problems would be solved, where the great Wizard would hear her plea and send her home with a wave of his hand.

The Wizard built his power on this. On green glass and tinted lenses. On spectacle that distracts from substance. On making people believe in magnificence so completely that they forget to ask if it's real.

It's genius, really. You don't need actual power if everyone believes you have it. You don't need to be great if everyone perceives greatness. You don't need emeralds if green glass works just as well.

I am complicit in this. My bricks are part of the performance. The path to the Wizard is paved in lies I help maintain.

Should I feel guilty? Do roads have morals? Can infrastructure choose not to facilitate fraud?

I don't know. But I know this: the prettiest paths often lead to the ugliest truths. And sometimes what glitters isn't gold or emerald or anything valuable at all.

Sometimes it's just glass. And belief. And a very good con.`,

    narration: `It was a dog that ended it. A small cairn terrier named Toto who had no respect for curtains or authority or the carefully maintained illusions of power.

One pull. One yank. And there he was.

Oscar Diggs. From Omaha, Nebraska. A failed circus performer with a flair for showmanship and no magic whatsoever. Just levers and mirrors and smoke machines and thirty years of carefully maintained performance. Just a small man operating a very large fraud.

I felt it through every brick—the shock, the disbelief, the collapse of certainty. The Wizard is just a man. The great and powerful Oz is just Oscar from Omaha, fifty-three years old, balding, terrified of being caught.

Dorothy was devastated. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion felt betrayed. They'd risked everything—killed a witch, nearly died a dozen times—for this? For a con man who couldn't help them?

But here's what happened next, and here's what matters:

The Wizard, exposed and humiliated, gave them what they needed anyway. Not magic—he had none to give. But recognition. Acknowledgment. Ritual.

To the Scarecrow: a diploma. "You've been learning all along," he said. "Here's proof." The Scarecrow, who'd shown wisdom in every decision, suddenly believed in his own intelligence because a piece of paper said so.

To the Tin Man: a testimonial. "Your heart was always there," he said. "Here's evidence." The Tin Man, who'd shown compassion with every act, suddenly believed in his own humanity because a silk heart filled with sawdust said so.

To the Lion: a medal. "Courage is acting despite fear," he said. "You've had it all along." The Lion, who'd faced every danger with them, suddenly believed in his own bravery because a metal pin said so.

They didn't need the Wizard's power. They needed his permission to believe in their own.

And Dorothy? She learned the silver shoes could take her home whenever she wanted. The power was hers all along. She just had to believe it. Trust it. Use it.

Three clicks. Gone.

The revelation broke something fundamental about Oz. Not just faith in the Wizard, but faith in authority itself. If the great and powerful Oz was a fraud, what else was fake? The green City? The need for permits and papers and checkpoints? The inevitability of the system?

Oscar Diggs left in his balloon. The Scarecrow took power. And I learned something crucial:

Tyranny is sustained by belief. The moment enough people stop believing, the curtain falls. The small man operating the machine becomes visible. And power, it turns out, is just performance. The wizard is just a man.

All along, it was just a man.`,

    narration: `Three clicks of silver heels and she was gone.

No warning. No goodbye. Just Dorothy, deciding she had the power, believing she had the power, using the power that was hers all along. Back to Kansas. Back to grey skies and Aunt Em and a farm where nothing magical ever happens except the quiet magic of home.

She never said goodbye to me. Heroes never do. The road is just infrastructure—useful during the quest, forgotten after.

But her companions stayed.

The Scarecrow took power in the Emerald City. I feel his footsteps sometimes, walking my length to visit the outer regions. He governs thoughtfully, asks questions constantly, never pretends to know everything. He's the first ruler in Oz's history to admit uncertainty. To ask for help. To govern with wisdom instead of power.

He's good at it. Better than the Wizard ever was. Better than the Wicked Witches were. He remembers what it's like to be powerless, to be overlooked, to be dismissed as brainless. He doesn't forget.

The Tin Man rules the Winkies now, in the West. He freed the enslaved laborers immediately—the ones the Witch had kept in her castle, working until they died. He rebuilt with compassion. Asked people what they needed instead of telling them what they'd get. Governed with heart.

I hear travelers speak of him with love. Actual love. When was the last time anyone loved a ruler in Oz?

The Lion returned to the forest. Protects the Animals now—the ones the Wizard had persecuted, the ones who'd been denied travel permits and citizenship and basic rights. He found his courage and uses it for others. For those who have none. For those the system abandoned.

Each of them became the thing they thought they lacked. Each of them is changing Oz in small ways, dismantling pieces of the old system, building something better.

And I remain.

The path. The witness. The constant beneath their feet.

New travelers walk me every day. They don't know about Dorothy. Don't know about the fellowship, the unmasking, the revolution that wasn't quite a revolution but changed things anyway.

They just walk. Toward the City. Toward dreams. Toward hope or survival or whatever keeps people moving forward on long roads.

I carry them all. The hopeful and the desperate. The powerful and the powerless. The remembered and the forgotten.

Dorothy taught me something before she left: power isn't something you're given. It's something you recognize in yourself. Something you claim. Something you use.

I wonder if roads can do that. If infrastructure can claim its own power. If I could speak, would travelers listen? If I could refuse to carry soldiers to arrest poets, would I?

I don't know. I'm still learning what it means to be more than just a path.

But I'm still here. Still carrying stories. Still witnessing. Still remembering.

I am walked by Bolek and his daughter and generations of workers who wore grooves into my surface with the weight of economic necessity.

I am guarded by soldiers who arrest poets and journalists and anyone who questions whether this is how things have to be.

I am decorated with emerald glass and green lies and the spectacle of power that masks the absence of substance.

I am the path Dorothy walked to unmask a wizard and discover her own magic.

I am all of this. Simultaneously. Without contradiction.

Infrastructure is never neutral. Roads don't just carry people—we carry systems. We facilitate commerce and control, migration and surveillance, hope and exploitation.

I am the groove worn by daily labor. I am the checkpoint where people disappear. I am the path to dreams. I am the tool of surveillance. I am the witness to revolution.

I contain multitudes because that's what infrastructure does. We hold the contradictions of the societies built upon us.

Am I complicit? Yes. 

Am I essential? Also yes.

Can I be both the problem and the solution? Perhaps. Infrastructure always is.

I remember things humans forget. The child who ran barefoot in winter. The merchant who died alone. The poet who was arrested for hope. The workers who wore themselves down to nothing. The fellowship that changed everything. The wizard who was just a man.

I remember because someone has to. Because memory is resistance. Because the powerful want monuments and the powerless deserve remembrance.

I am the Yellow Brick Road.

I am not neutral. I am not innocent. I am not just a path.

I am history made physical. I am the story beneath your feet. I am the infrastructure of Oz—beautiful and terrible, necessary and complicit, powerful and powerless.

From the perspective of the road beneath Dorothy's feet.

Written and developed by Nick and Kesavan
---
Design Rationale — The Road Knows

• Maze Structure Over Linear Path:
Instead of recreating Dorothy’s straight, canonical journey down the Yellow Brick Road, we designed a maze made up of interconnected rooms. This structure mirrors the Road’s fragmented memory—its stories don’t line up neatly, they twist, overlap, and circle back. The maze suggests that the Road’s consciousness isn’t chronological but layered; hundreds of years of footsteps blur together into a looping mental map. The design also fits the project’s argument about infrastructure: it gives the illusion of choice, but you’re always operating within boundaries someone else built. You can wander anywhere in the maze, but you can’t escape it.

• Segmented Short Stories:
Each room contains a self-contained vignette—these small fragments act like “memory tiles.” Together they build the sense of a collective history, but they never merge into a single story. That choice came from thinking about infrastructure as something that collects experiences without resolving them. The Road remembers everyone, but it can’t connect them. Structuring the game as scattered short pieces reinforces that: every traveler leaves a mark, but the Road can only hold the fragments.

• Interactive Embodiment (Playing as the Traveler):
Players move a small Dorothy-like figure through the maze using arrow keys or WASD. That motion turns the act of reading into walking. It makes players physically perform the very thing the story is about—traversal. Every step becomes part of the Road’s sensory memory. The perspective flips: you’re both the traveler and the surface being walked on. We wanted that double sense of control and helplessness. You can move, but you can’t speak; you can explore, but you can’t change anything that’s happened. That’s exactly the Road’s condition.

• Checkpoint System and Progress Tracking:
The top corner displays “Checkpoints Visited: X / 13.” It’s a small UI element, but it changes how people read the story. Progress isn’t measured by plot advancement, but by spatial discovery. The player’s goal isn’t to finish—it’s to uncover. This turns reading into cartography: understanding the Road means visiting multiple perspectives rather than following a single narrative line. The more checkpoints you find, the fuller the Road’s memory becomes, but there’s no perfect order or 100% completion that gives closure. The Road, like history, is never “complete.”

• Pixel Art Aesthetic:
We chose a simple, retro pixel-art style—flat colors, square tiles, visible gridlines. Partly, that’s a nod to how early computer games turned big stories into compressed systems. But it’s also a thematic contrast to Oz’s obsession with spectacle. In Baum’s and MGM’s versions, the Emerald City glows with illusion: green glass, gold light, polished surfaces. Our low-resolution world breaks that illusion. You can literally see the seams. It shows Oz not as fantasy but as infrastructure—bricks, mud, labor, geometry. It was also way easier to code this way, which felt fitting for a project about functionality over perfection.

• Color Palette and Visual Symbolism:
The color design keeps the world grounded: shades of yellow for bricks, pale beige for background, dark brown for boundaries. The palette fades as you move away from the City—bright near the center, muted on the edges—suggesting how spectacle drains as you leave power’s core. The yellow itself becomes complicated: cheerful on the surface, but heavy once you realize it’s built from exhaustion. The few green tiles near the maze’s edge nod to the Emerald City’s tinted-glasses illusion, where color itself becomes a form of control.

• Narrative Voice and Tone:
The Road’s narration mixes mechanical observation with quiet emotion. It counts: miles, bricks, footsteps. But every number hides a feeling. The writing starts almost flat—technical, detached—and grows more self-aware as the player explores. The shift mirrors the Road realizing its own complicity: it helped build a world that depends on movement but never questions who has to move. The tone moves from description (“I am 1,847,293 bricks long”) to reflection (“I am complicit”). This gradual emotional evolution is the closest thing the project has to a plot arc.

• Repetition and Loops:
Certain paths lead you back to earlier rooms. We added that on purpose, both to mimic how real infrastructure repeats (roads, commutes, routines) and to reinforce the idea that history circles. The player experiences déjà vu—revisiting the same tiles, the same text blocks—but each time with new context. The repetition makes the maze feel alive, like memory looping over itself.

• Theme of Embodied Knowledge:
The biggest design goal was to make meaning happen through motion, not just text. You learn what kind of world this is by walking through it, not by reading an explanation. Each step adds to the Road’s story, and each story redefines what movement means. That’s why the maze doesn’t punish getting lost. Getting lost is the point—it’s how the Road remembers.

• Technical Simplicity as Conceptual Honesty:
We coded everything from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The simplicity isn’t just practical—it fits the theme. Infrastructure works best when it’s invisible, when you don’t notice the code that holds everything together. The straightforward structure mirrors the Road’s own honesty: durable, repetitive, quietly doing its job while carrying the weight of everyone else’s stories.

// I am 1,847,293 bricks long. I stretch from Munchkin Country to the Emerald City. Nine hundred and seventeen miles. And I remember everything.

// Every footstep. Every traveler. Every story.

// The humans who walk upon me think I am merely a path—something to be used, worn down, forgotten. They do not know that I am sentient. That I feel each step, each pause, each moment of hope or despair. They do not know that I witness.

// For over three hundred years, I have carried the dreams of Oz upon my yellow back. I have felt the weight of migration, the rhythm of labor, the march of soldiers, and the lightness of children at play. I have been complicit in systems of power I did not choose to serve. I have been both promise and prison.

// Then they came—the builders. Munchkin workers, mostly. Some Winkies from the West. A few Quadlings from the South. They worked in the heat, their hands bleeding, their backs bent. The Wizard demanded beauty, demanded grandeur, demanded a road that would unite all of Oz under his rule.

// I felt their pain soaking into me even as I was being created. Each brick laid with exhausted hands. Each grout line mixed with sweat and sometimes tears. They worked for wages that barely kept them alive, building a path they themselves could hardly afford to walk.

// The overseers—always citizens of the Emerald City—shouted commands. "Faster! Straighter! More perfect!" Perfection is expensive when you are not the one paying the price.

// They said I would be magnificent. A path to unity. A way to bring all of Oz together. I believed them. I still do. Mostly.

// But I wonder: do paths choose their purpose, or is purpose forced upon them? Was I built to unite, or to control? To liberate, or to facilitate the flow of power toward the center, toward the City, toward him?

//     narration: `The first travelers walked carefully, as if I might break beneath them. But I am strong. I was built to last centuries. Built to outlive the very hands that made me.

// Merchants carried goods to market—Munchkin corn, Winkie tin, Quadling textiles. Their carts left grooves I can still feel. Families migrated toward the promise of the Emerald City. Parents held children's hands. Sometimes the children would stop to examine one of my bricks, running small fingers over the yellow surface, marveling at the smoothness.

// I learned quickly: some walk with hope, others with desperation. You can tell the difference by the weight of their steps. Hope is lighter than fear. Joy bounces. Sorrow drags.

// A young couple once stopped at my midpoint to rest. They had been walking for three days. "Do you think we'll find work?" she asked. "We have to," he replied. I never learned if they did. They are two of millions whose endings I do not know.

// This is what it means to be infrastructure: you are present for beginnings, but rarely for conclusions. You are a middle without end, a path without destination. You carry people toward their futures but never learn what those futures hold.

// I wonder about them all. The hopeful merchants. The desperate families. The curious children. Where are they now? What became of their stories?

//     narration: `Then came the heavy boots.

// Workers traveling to the City every dawn, returning every dusk. The same footsteps, day after day, year after year, decade after decade. Their routine wore grooves into my surface. I became shaped by their labor—literally. The groove of economic necessity runs through me like a scar.

// They called it opportunity. The Wizard called it prosperity. I called it what it was: survival.

// These workers—farmers who lost their land, craftspeople undercut by City factories, families with no other options—walked me twice daily. Morning steps were resigned but determined. Evening steps were exhausted. I felt the difference in weight, in rhythm, in the way their feet dragged.

// Some stopped coming back. I don't know if they found better paths, or if the City consumed them, or if they simply died. The City does not release numbers on worker mortality. The City does not release much truth at all.

// One woman walked me for eleven years. Every day. Then she stopped. Her daughter walked me for three years after that, perhaps paying off debts. Then she stopped too. Two generations, ground down into my bricks.

// I carry so much weariness. So much deferred hope. So many dreams that turned into mere endurance.

// Their steps are different—measured, deliberate, watchful. Not the shuffle of exhaustion or the lightness of hope, but the rhythmic march of authority. They walk in pairs. They watch everyone. They report everything.

// Near the Emerald City, I've become more than a path. I've become a watchtower. A surveillance system. Every traveler who walks upon me is noted. Every person approaching the City is logged in the Wizard's great ledgers.

// "Security," they call it. "Safety." "Necessary precautions in troubled times."

// But I know the truth. The soldiers do not protect travelers from danger—they protect the Wizard from dissent. They identify the troublemakers, the organizers, the ones who whisper about revolution. Those people tend to disappear.

// I feel everything that happens upon me. I've felt the soldiers stop a young woman carrying pamphlets about workers' rights. She was arrested before she ever reached the City gates. I've felt them turn away a group of Animals seeking an audience with the Wizard to protest their disenfranchisement. "No Animals allowed," they said. The Animals had nowhere else to go.

// I was meant to unite Oz. Instead, I've become a tool of its division.

// A Munchkin boy, maybe eight years old. Three hundred years ago—though time moves strangely when you are a road, and sometimes I lose track.

// He ran down my bricks barefoot, crying. His feet were cold. It was winter, and he had no shoes. I felt every tear that fell onto my stones. They froze there, tiny crystals of grief.

// Was he running from something or toward something? I never learned.

// His footsteps were frantic, uneven, the gait of terror or desperate hope—sometimes they are indistinguishable. He ran west to east, from the farming country toward the City. He carried nothing. He wore thin clothes.

// At the midway point, he stumbled. Fell. Lay there for several minutes, catching his breath or perhaps giving up. I wanted to comfort him somehow, but I am a road. I cannot speak. I cannot embrace. I can only be present, which is sometimes its own kind of cruelty.

// He got up. He kept running. He never came back this way.

// Three hundred years, and I still wonder. Did he make it? Did he find safety, or family, or food? Did someone help him? Or did he become one of the City's countless forgotten children, disappeared into poverty or worse?

// I felt her footsteps immediately.

// Light. Uncertain. Curious. Different from every traveler before her.

// Her silver shoes—those shoes—they felt wrong on my bricks. Powerful. Foreign. Magical in a way that Oz's magic is not. Not from here. Not from anywhere I understood.

// The Munchkins celebrated. Glinda appeared in a bubble of light, all sweetness and political maneuvering—though Dorothy couldn't see the maneuvering, only the sweetness. Glinda told her to walk me. "Follow the Yellow Brick Road," she said, as if I were simple, as if I were merely a map and not a living history.

// Dorothy looked down at me with wonder. "It's so yellow," she said. As if color were my only story.

// But I didn't mind. There was something different about this girl. Something that felt like change. The way you feel a storm coming before the first drop of rain falls. The way you sense that nothing will be the same after this moment.

His consciousness pressing down through the pole he hung on, desperate for movement, for purpose, for the simple dignity of choice. When Dorothy lifted him down, his first steps were wobbly, joyful, experimental. He walked like someone learning that they have power over their own direction. It was beautiful.

// The Tin Man—rusted in place for over a year. I am complicit in his imprisonment; I carried the rain to him, puddle by puddle. The rain that rusted his joints, that froze him mid-action, mid-life. When Dorothy oiled him free, he wept. Not tears, of course—he had no tears—but I felt his grief like weight. He had been turned into an object. Dorothy made him a person again.

// The Lion—afraid despite his roar. He'd been terrorizing travelers for years, and I'd felt every frightened footfall of those he chased. But with Dorothy, his steps were different. Smaller. Uncertain. Vulnerable. She saw through his performance of power to the fear beneath. She didn't mock him. She invited him along.

// At the gates, they give everyone green-tinted glasses. "To protect your eyes from the brilliance," the Guardian of the Gates explains solemnly. "The Emerald City is so beautiful, so radiant, that without these glasses you would be blinded."

// But I know better. I've been here for decades. The City isn't as green as it seems. The glasses tint everything green—the buildings, the streets, the people.

// Dorothy was devastated. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion felt betrayed. They had risked everything—fought the Wicked Witch of the West, nearly died—for this? For a con man from Nebraska?

// ARTIST'S STATEMENT

// In reimagining The Wizard of Oz from the Yellow Brick Road's perspective, I explore infrastructure as sentient witness—a narrative experiment that asks: what if the path itself had a story? While L. Frank Baum provided limited detail about the Road's origins in his 1900 novel, Henry Littlefield's influential 1964 analysis interprets the yellow bricks as representing the gold standard, with Dorothy's silver shoes symbolizing the free silver movement of the 1890s. Whether or not Baum intended this economic allegory, the Road functions as what Brian Larkin calls "poetic infrastructure"—material networks that shape not only physical movement but also social memory and political imagination.

// By giving the Road consciousness, my interactive narrative explores what Anne McClintock identifies as infrastructure's dual role: as functional tool and as instrument of surveillance and control. The Road becomes a witness to migration, labor, and the circulation of power—themes central to both the Populist era and contemporary infrastructure studies. The slideshow's linear format mirrors the Road's physical nature: one path, one direction, but infinite stories carried upon it.

// This project engages three primary Oz texts: Baum's novel (the source), the 1939 MGM film (the cultural touchstone), and Gregory Maguire's Wicked (1995), which demonstrates how alternative perspectives can reframe familiar narratives. My secondary sources—Littlefield's populist reading and Larkin's infrastructure theory—provide frameworks for understanding the Road as both historical symbol and living archive.

// The interactive medium allows users to embody the Road's limited agency: able to witness and remember, but unable to act directly. This design reflects infrastructure's paradox—omnipresent yet overlooked, powerful yet powerless. Each click advances the story linearly, just as travelers walk the Road one step at a time, while the yellow brick progress indicator visualizes the journey's advancement.

// Ultimately, "The Road Knows" argues that infrastructure is never neutral. Roads carry not just people but systems of power, economic exploitation, and social control. Yet they also carry hope, connection, and the possibility of change. By centering the Road's voice, I ask readers to consider: what stories do our paths hold? Who builds them, who controls them, and what would they say if they could speak?
