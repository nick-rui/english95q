# Character Images (Optional)

These are optional decorative elements that can be displayed on slides where characters are introduced.

## Optional Character PNGs (300x400px, transparent background):

1. **dummy-dorothy.png** - Girl in blue dress, pigtails, silver shoes
2. **dummy-scarecrow.png** - Scarecrow figure with hat, straw showing
3. **dummy-tinman.png** - Metallic figure with funnel hat, ax
4. **dummy-lion.png** - Lion with mane, looking both fierce and gentle
5. **dummy-wizard.png** - Small man with mustache, Victorian clothing

Note: The application works perfectly without these images. They are purely optional decorative elements.
