> **New!** The yellow brick road is now fully interactive. Click any brick to jump to that part of the story. No need to go through slides sequentially!

### Adding Images

1. Create or source images matching the descriptions in `/public/assets/slide-backgrounds/README.md`
2. Save them with the exact filenames specified (e.g., `slide1-single-brick.png`)
3. Place them in the `/public/assets/slide-backgrounds/` directory
4. The app will automatically use them instead of placeholders

**Note**: The app displays beautiful CSS gradient placeholders if images are not present, so images are optional for functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **Google Fonts** - Cinzel and Libre Baskerville
- **LocalStorage API** - Progress persistence

## üìö Academic Context

This project engages with:

- **Primary Sources**: Baum's *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* (1900), Maguire's *Wicked* (1995), MGM's *The Wizard of Oz* (1939)
- **Secondary Sources**: Littlefield's populist reading, Larkin's infrastructure theory, McClintock's work on surveillance

The narrative explores infrastructure as witness, examining the Road's dual role as both tool of connection and instrument of control.

## ‚ö° Performance

- Lightweight bundle size
- Optimized for fast loading
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive on all devices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Fonts not loading
Ensure you have an internet connection. Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN.

### Progress not saving
Check browser localStorage is enabled. Some privacy modes disable this feature.

### Blank slides
This is normal if image files aren't present. CSS placeholders will display instead.
