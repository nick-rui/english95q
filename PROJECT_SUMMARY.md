## 🟡 Final Notes

This project is **complete and ready for deployment**. The interactive slideshow successfully transforms your English 95Q narrative into a beautiful, engaging web experience. The content—your retelling of The Wizard of Oz from the Road's perspective—is preserved verbatim and presented in a format that honors both the literary and technical aspects of the project.

The application demonstrates sophisticated understanding of infrastructure theory while providing an accessible, emotionally resonant reading experience. The Yellow Brick Road's voice comes through clearly: witness, participant, victim, and ultimately, storyteller.

**Estimated time to deployment**: 5-10 minutes
**Estimated total project time**: 10-15 minutes reading experience

**The Road is ready to tell its story. 🟡→🟡→🟡**

*"I am infrastructure. I am history made physical. I am the path beneath your feet and the story you don't see."*
