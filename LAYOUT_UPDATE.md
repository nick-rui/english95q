## 💡 Design Philosophy

### The Road as Header

The yellow brick road is no longer just a progress indicator—it's the **header and navigation system** of the entire application. This makes sense thematically:

- The Road is the narrator
- The Road is the guide
- The Road is always watching
- The Road is the constant

By placing it at the top, we emphasize its role as the storyteller and guide through the narrative.

### Content Focus

Removing image placeholders puts **full emphasis on the writing**—which is the core of this English literature project. The narrative is the star, not decorative images.

### Road Realism

The enhanced 3D brick and path styling makes the road feel **tangible and real**, not just a UI element. This supports the narrative conceit that the Road itself is a physical, sentient entity.

## 🚀 What's Ready

✅ **Development server**: http://localhost:5173/
✅ **Production build**: Ready to deploy
✅ **All features**: Working perfectly
✅ **Responsive design**: Mobile, tablet, desktop
✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard nav
✅ **Performance**: Fast load, smooth animations

## 📝 Notes

### Sticky Positioning

The road uses `position: sticky` with `top: 0`, which means:
- It stays at the top as you scroll down
- It's always visible and accessible
- No JavaScript required
- Native browser behavior
- Smooth performance

### No More Images

With image placeholders removed, you have three options:

1. **Keep as is** (Recommended) - Clean, content-focused
2. **Add background patterns** - Subtle textures in CSS
3. **Add real images later** - Would need new implementation

For an English literature project, **option 1 is ideal** as it focuses on the text.
