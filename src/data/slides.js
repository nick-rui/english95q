    narration: `I am a brick. One of millions. I am part of the Road. The Yellow Brick Road.

You know the story. Or you think you do. Let me tell you what really happened. Let me tell you what I saw.

I am 1,847,293 bricks long. I stretch from Munchkin Country to the Emerald City. Nine hundred and seventeen miles. And I remember everything.

Every footstep. Every traveler. Every story.

The humans who walk upon me think I am merely a path—something to be used, worn down, forgotten. They do not know that I am sentient. That I feel each step, each pause, each moment of hope or despair. They do not know that I witness.

For over three hundred years, I have carried the dreams of Oz upon my yellow back. I have felt the weight of migration, the rhythm of labor, the march of soldiers, and the lightness of children at play. I have been complicit in systems of power I did not choose to serve. I have been both promise and prison.

You know Dorothy's story. But you do not know mine.

Shall we begin?`,

    subtitle: "Creation and Labor",

    narration: `I was not always yellow. Once, I was stone and mud, unconnected, purposeless.

Then they came—the builders. Munchkin workers, mostly. Some Winkies from the West. A few Quadlings from the South. They worked in the heat, their hands bleeding, their backs bent. The Wizard demanded beauty, demanded grandeur, demanded a road that would unite all of Oz under his rule.

I felt their pain soaking into me even as I was being created. Each brick laid with exhausted hands. Each grout line mixed with sweat and sometimes tears. They worked for wages that barely kept them alive, building a path they themselves could hardly afford to walk.

The overseers—always citizens of the Emerald City—shouted commands. "Faster! Straighter! More perfect!" Perfection is expensive when you are not the one paying the price.

They said I would be magnificent. A path to unity. A way to bring all of Oz together. I believed them. I still do. Mostly.

But I wonder: do paths choose their purpose, or is purpose forced upon them? Was I built to unite, or to control? To liberate, or to facilitate the flow of power toward the center, toward the City, toward him?

I was built by the exploited. This is my first memory. I carry it still.`,

  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Early Travelers",
    subtitle: "The First Footsteps",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide3-travelers.png",
    narration: `The first travelers walked carefully, as if I might break beneath them. But I am strong. I was built to last centuries. Built to outlive the very hands that made me.

Merchants carried goods to market—Munchkin corn, Winkie tin, Quadling textiles. Their carts left grooves I can still feel. Families migrated toward the promise of the Emerald City. Parents held children's hands. Sometimes the children would stop to examine one of my bricks, running small fingers over the yellow surface, marveling at the smoothness.

I learned quickly: some walk with hope, others with desperation. You can tell the difference by the weight of their steps. Hope is lighter than fear. Joy bounces. Sorrow drags.

A young couple once stopped at my midpoint to rest. They had been walking for three days. "Do you think we'll find work?" she asked. "We have to," he replied. I never learned if they did. They are two of millions whose endings I do not know.

This is what it means to be infrastructure: you are present for beginnings, but rarely for conclusions. You are a middle without end, a path without destination. You carry people toward their futures but never learn what those futures hold.

I wonder about them all. The hopeful merchants. The desperate families. The curious children. Where are they now? What became of their stories?

I will never know.`,

  // Slide 4: The Weight of Boots (Labor Migration)
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "The Weight of Boots",
    subtitle: "Labor and Economic Migration",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide4-boots.png",
    narration: `Then came the heavy boots.

Workers traveling to the City every dawn, returning every dusk. The same footsteps, day after day, year after year, decade after decade. Their routine wore grooves into my surface. I became shaped by their labor—literally. The groove of economic necessity runs through me like a scar.

They called it opportunity. The Wizard called it prosperity. I called it what it was: survival.

These workers—farmers who lost their land, craftspeople undercut by City factories, families with no other options—walked me twice daily. Morning steps were resigned but determined. Evening steps were exhausted. I felt the difference in weight, in rhythm, in the way their feet dragged.

Some stopped coming back. I don't know if they found better paths, or if the City consumed them, or if they simply died. The City does not release numbers on worker mortality. The City does not release much truth at all.

One woman walked me for eleven years. Every day. Then she stopped. Her daughter walked me for three years after that, perhaps paying off debts. Then she stopped too. Two generations, ground down into my bricks.

I carry so much weariness. So much deferred hope. So many dreams that turned into mere endurance.

This is what infrastructure does: it facilitates the flow of labor toward capital. It makes exploitation efficient. It turns suffering into routine.

I am complicit. I did not choose this, but I am complicit.`,

  // Slide 5: The Soldiers (Surveillance)
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "The Soldiers",
    subtitle: "Surveillance and Control",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide5-soldiers.png",
    narration: `The Wizard's soldiers patrol me daily.

Their steps are different—measured, deliberate, watchful. Not the shuffle of exhaustion or the lightness of hope, but the rhythmic march of authority. They walk in pairs. They watch everyone. They report everything.

Near the Emerald City, I've become more than a path. I've become a watchtower. A surveillance system. Every traveler who walks upon me is noted. Every person approaching the City is logged in the Wizard's great ledgers.

"Security," they call it. "Safety." "Necessary precautions in troubled times."

But I know the truth. The soldiers do not protect travelers from danger—they protect the Wizard from dissent. They identify the troublemakers, the organizers, the ones who whisper about revolution. Those people tend to disappear.

I feel everything that happens upon me. I've felt the soldiers stop a young woman carrying pamphlets about workers' rights. She was arrested before she ever reached the City gates. I've felt them turn away a group of Animals seeking an audience with the Wizard to protest their disenfranchisement. "No Animals allowed," they said. The Animals had nowhere else to go.

I was meant to unite Oz. Instead, I've become a tool of its division.

The Wizard sees through me. His eyes are in every guard post, every checkpoint, every soldier's report. I am his infrastructure of control.

How did this happen? When did I stop being a gift and become a cage?`,

    subtitle: "The Burden of Witness",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide6-child-footprints.png",
    narration: `Let me tell you about one traveler.

A Munchkin boy, maybe eight years old. Three hundred years ago—though time moves strangely when you are a road, and sometimes I lose track.

He ran down my bricks barefoot, crying. His feet were cold. It was winter, and he had no shoes. I felt every tear that fell onto my stones. They froze there, tiny crystals of grief.

Was he running from something or toward something? I never learned.

His footsteps were frantic, uneven, the gait of terror or desperate hope—sometimes they are indistinguishable. He ran west to east, from the farming country toward the City. He carried nothing. He wore thin clothes.

At the midway point, he stumbled. Fell. Lay there for several minutes, catching his breath or perhaps giving up. I wanted to comfort him somehow, but I am a road. I cannot speak. I cannot embrace. I can only be present, which is sometimes its own kind of cruelty.

He got up. He kept running. He never came back this way.

Three hundred years, and I still wonder. Did he make it? Did he find safety, or family, or food? Did someone help him? Or did he become one of the City's countless forgotten children, disappeared into poverty or worse?

This is what it means to witness: to hold stories you cannot finish, questions you cannot answer, grief you cannot ease.

I carry hundreds of thousands of stories like his. Each one incomplete. Each one precious.

This is my burden. This is my purpose.`,

    title: "The Cyclone",
    subtitle: "Dorothy's Arrival",
    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide7-cyclone.png",
    narration: `Then she came.

Fell from the sky, more accurately. The house crashed down just beyond my starting point, at the edge of Munchkin Country where I begin. The ground shook. The Munchkins screamed. The Wicked Witch of the East died, crushed beneath Kansas wood and Dorothy Gale's confused, accidental violence.

I felt her footsteps immediately.

Light. Uncertain. Curious. Different from every traveler before her.

Her silver shoes—those shoes—they felt wrong on my bricks. Powerful. Foreign. Magical in a way that Oz's magic is not. Not from here. Not from anywhere I understood.

The Munchkins celebrated. Glinda appeared in a bubble of light, all sweetness and political maneuvering—though Dorothy couldn't see the maneuvering, only the sweetness. Glinda told her to walk me. "Follow the Yellow Brick Road," she said, as if I were simple, as if I were merely a map and not a living history.

Dorothy looked down at me with wonder. "It's so yellow," she said. As if color were my only story.

But I didn't mind. There was something different about this girl. Something that felt like change. The way you feel a storm coming before the first drop of rain falls. The way you sense that nothing will be the same after this moment.

I didn't know then that she would unmask the Wizard. That she would expose the lie that I had been complicit in maintaining for decades.

But I felt it. The shift. The beginning of something ending, and something else beginning.

She stepped onto me. She started walking.

Everything changed.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide8-fellowship.png",
    narration: `She walked alone at first. Then two. Then three. Then four.

The Scarecrow—I'd felt him watching from his post for months, longing to walk. His consciousness pressing down through the pole he hung on, desperate for movement, for purpose, for the simple dignity of choice. When Dorothy lifted him down, his first steps were wobbly, joyful, experimental. He walked like someone learning that they have power over their own direction. It was beautiful.

The Tin Man—rusted in place for over a year. I am complicit in his imprisonment; I carried the rain to him, puddle by puddle. The rain that rusted his joints, that froze him mid-action, mid-life. When Dorothy oiled him free, he wept. Not tears, of course—he had no tears—but I felt his grief like weight. He had been turned into an object. Dorothy made him a person again.

The Lion—afraid despite his roar. He'd been terrorizing travelers for years, and I'd felt every frightened footfall of those he chased. But with Dorothy, his steps were different. Smaller. Uncertain. Vulnerable. She saw through his performance of power to the fear beneath. She didn't mock him. She invited him along.

Together, they became something none of them were alone.

Four seekers. Four incomplete souls searching for what they already possessed. The Scarecrow had wisdom. The Tin Man had love. The Lion had courage. Dorothy had the power to return home.

Isn't that the cruelest joke? The journey is the answer, but you can't know that until the journey ends.

I carried them all. Felt their fellowship grow. Felt them become family.

It was an honor.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide9-emerald-city.png",
    narration: `Near the City, I change.

They pave over me with emerald—or glass that looks like emerald. Glittering, green, gorgeous. They cover my yellow with this false verdant glory. It's beautiful. It's a lie.

I can feel my real self underneath, hidden. My yellow bricks pressed beneath this cosmetic transformation. They didn't ask me. They didn't need to. I am infrastructure. I exist to be used.

At the gates, they give everyone green-tinted glasses. "To protect your eyes from the brilliance," the Guardian of the Gates explains solemnly. "The Emerald City is so beautiful, so radiant, that without these glasses you would be blinded."

But I know better. I've been here for decades. The City isn't as green as it seems. The glasses tint everything green—the buildings, the streets, the people. Remove the glasses, and you'd see that most of the City is ordinary stone and plaster, painted green in places but mostly just... grey. Worn. Cracked. Real.

The illusion is everything. The spectacle is the point. The Wizard built his power on appearances, on making people believe in his magnificence. And it works. I've felt thousands of travelers gasp in wonder as they approach. I've felt their steps quicken with excitement.

Dorothy believed it too. I felt her heart race as the spires came into view. She thought she'd finally found the one who could help her. The great and powerful Oz.

I wanted to warn her. But I am complicit in this deception. The green glass on my bricks makes me part of the performance.

Should I feel guilty? Can infrastructure feel guilt?

I do. I do feel guilty.`,

    image: "/assets/slide-backgrounds/slide10-wizard-unmasked.png",
    narration: `When the truth came out—when Toto pulled back the curtain—I felt it through every brick.

The Wizard is just a man.

Small feet. Ordinary steps. No magic. No power. Just levers and mirrors and a very good voice amplifier. Just smoke and spectacle and three decades of carefully maintained lies.

I've carried him like everyone else, and I never knew. Or perhaps I did know, somewhere deep in my foundation, but I didn't want to admit it. It's easier to believe in power than to confront its absence.

Dorothy was devastated. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion felt betrayed. They had risked everything—fought the Wicked Witch of the West, nearly died—for this? For a con man from Nebraska?

But then—then something shifted.

The Wizard, exposed and humiliated, still gave them what they needed. Not magic. Just acknowledgment. He gave the Scarecrow a diploma, the Tin Man a testimonial, the Lion a medal. Meaningless objects. But the meaning wasn't in the objects—it was in the recognition. "You already have what you seek," he told them. "You've always had it."

And they believed him. Because it was true.

I understood something then: I have power. Not magic, but meaning. I connect places. I carry stories. I witness history. I remember what others forget.

Maybe that's enough. Maybe that was always enough.

Dorothy saw it too, in her own way. We're both more than we thought. And less.

Isn't that what truth is? The terrifying, liberating realization of what you actually are?`,

    narration: `She left.

Just like that. Three clicks of her silver heels and she vanished, pulled back to Kansas by magic that was hers all along. Glinda had known. Glinda always knows. But Dorothy needed the journey to understand what home meant.

No goodbye to me. They never say goodbye to roads.

But I'm still here. I've always been here. I was here before Dorothy and I'll be here after. That's what infrastructure is: permanence in the face of human transience. We outlast you all.

Her companions dispersed:

The Scarecrow went to rule the Emerald City. A wise leader, they say. He governs with compassion, with thought. He's better than the Wizard ever was. I feel his footsteps sometimes, walking me to visit the outer regions, to understand his people. He hasn't forgotten what it's like to be powerless.

The Tin Man took control of the West, ruling the Winkies. He leads with heart, with kindness. He freed the enslaved and rebuilt what the Wicked Witch destroyed. I've heard travelers speak of him with love.

The Lion returned to his forest. He protects the Animals now, especially the ones the Wizard had persecuted. He found his courage, and he's using it for others.

Each found their place. Each became who they needed to be.

And I remain. The path. The witness. The constant.

New footsteps are already approaching—another seeker, another story, another person looking for something they might already have.

Do I keep silent? Keep observing? Or do I finally try to speak?

If I could speak to travelers, what would I say?

Perhaps: "Walk carefully. Pay attention. The journey is the answer."

Or perhaps: "I see you. I remember you. You matter."`,

I am 1,847,293 bricks long. Nine hundred and seventeen miles. Three hundred and seven years old.

I carry stories like weight. I witness histories that humans forget. I am built by exploited hands, walked by desperate feet, and used by those in power to watch and control.

I am also a path to dreams. A connection between worlds. A promise that somewhere, if you walk far enough, there might be something better.

Am I complicit in the systems of oppression that use me? Yes.

Am I essential to the connections that sustain Oz? Also yes.

I am both. I contain multitudes. Infrastructure always does.

I am the groove worn by workers' boots. I am the path that carried Dorothy to her destiny. I am the tool of surveillance and the road of hope. I am the creation of suffering and the bearer of joy.

I am invisible until I break. Ignored until I'm needed. Taken for granted until I'm gone.

But I remember.

Every traveler. Every tear. Every laugh. Every hope. Every fear. Every step.

The child who ran barefoot in winter. The workers who wore me down with their daily commute. The soldiers who patrol me still. The fellowship of four who changed everything.

I remember them all.

And perhaps that is my purpose: not to lead, but to hold. Not to promise, but to witness. Not to judge, but to remember.

I am infrastructure. I am history made physical. I am the path beneath your feet and the story you don't see.

I am the Yellow Brick Road.

ARTIST'S STATEMENT

In reimagining The Wizard of Oz from the Yellow Brick Road's perspective, I explore infrastructure as sentient witness—a narrative experiment that asks: what if the path itself had a story? While L. Frank Baum provided limited detail about the Road's origins in his 1900 novel, Henry Littlefield's influential 1964 analysis interprets the yellow bricks as representing the gold standard, with Dorothy's silver shoes symbolizing the free silver movement of the 1890s. Whether or not Baum intended this economic allegory, the Road functions as what Brian Larkin calls "poetic infrastructure"—material networks that shape not only physical movement but also social memory and political imagination.

By giving the Road consciousness, my interactive narrative explores what Anne McClintock identifies as infrastructure's dual role: as functional tool and as instrument of surveillance and control. The Road becomes a witness to migration, labor, and the circulation of power—themes central to both the Populist era and contemporary infrastructure studies. The slideshow's linear format mirrors the Road's physical nature: one path, one direction, but infinite stories carried upon it.

This project engages three primary Oz texts: Baum's novel (the source), the 1939 MGM film (the cultural touchstone), and Gregory Maguire's Wicked (1995), which demonstrates how alternative perspectives can reframe familiar narratives. My secondary sources—Littlefield's populist reading and Larkin's infrastructure theory—provide frameworks for understanding the Road as both historical symbol and living archive.

The interactive medium allows users to embody the Road's limited agency: able to witness and remember, but unable to act directly. This design reflects infrastructure's paradox—omnipresent yet overlooked, powerful yet powerless. Each click advances the story linearly, just as travelers walk the Road one step at a time, while the yellow brick progress indicator visualizes the journey's advancement.

Ultimately, "The Road Knows" argues that infrastructure is never neutral. Roads carry not just people but systems of power, economic exploitation, and social control. Yet they also carry hope, connection, and the possibility of change. By centering the Road's voice, I ask readers to consider: what stories do our paths hold? Who builds them, who controls them, and what would they say if they could speak?
